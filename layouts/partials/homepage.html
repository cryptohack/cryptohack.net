  <p>The internet is an amazing tool for freedom of information, communication and education. But it's under attack from corporate interests and dragnet government surveillance.</p>

  <p><strong>There is hope!</strong> We have the tools to help everyone take control of their privacy. More and more people are encrypting their communications, but many of the tools are still hard to use.

  <p><strong>Hackers for Privacy</strong> have the technical skills (UX, testing, security, development, etc) to improve the tools so everyone can benefit from them.</p>

  <p><strong>Hackers for Privacy</strong> have the will to stand up and defend our digital privacy.</p>

  <p>Are you a <strong>Hacker for Privacy?</strong></p>
