title = "Announcing Internet Freedom Hack: Defending Truth"
+++

Internet Freedom Hack is a community event that brings technologists with a passion for digital rights together for a weekend to build things that advance the cause of internet freedom. 

We're announcing the next Internet Freedom Hack that will run in Brisbane on 20th-22nd April 2018 and, for the first time, simultaneously in Melbourne on 20th-21st April 2018.

On this occasion the theme is "Defending Truth", a cause we can surely all get behind given the [news](https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files) from the last few days about [fake news](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/19/cambridge-analytica-execs-boast-dirty-tricks-honey-traps-elections), [data abuse](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/3kjzvk/facebook-cambridge-analytica-not-a-data-breach) and [election "influencing"](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/20/cambridge-analytica-execs-boast-of-role-in-getting-trump-elected).

On the evening of Saturday 21st April, the hacking will pause for an event with wider public appeal, seeking greater public attention, policy impact, and industry engagement, where speakers will cover topics such as: defending encryption; battling fake news; scapegoated "hackers"; peer-to-peer publication of academic research; open source transparency projects; and dynamic disposable VPN's. Where possible, talks will be streamed live between the two cities and made available online. 

Registration for the Melbourne and Brisbane events is open now and more information, including a list of speakers, is available on the website: [**internetfreedomhack.org**](https://internetfreedomhack.org).
