[Internet Freedom Hack](https://internetfreedomhack.org) is a community hackathon that brings technologists and people with a passion for digital rights together to build software that advances the cause of internet freedom. It will run for the third time in Brisbane and Melbourne on the weekend of Aaron Swartz Day, 9th-11th November 2018

We're announcing the next Internet Freedom Hack in partnership with the Australian Privacy Foundation, Blueprint for Free Speech, CryptoParty Melbourne, Digital Rights Watch, Electronic Frontiers Australia, QUT, and ThoughtWorks.

Previous Internet Freedom Hack projects have fought against government censorship regimes, propaganda and fake news on Facebook, and the opt-out period for MyHealthRecord. This time we're up against the Australian Governmentâ€™s attack on encryption.

Any project that fits under the broad umbrella of internet freedom, including anything that aligns closely with Aaron Swartz's work on transparency and accountability, is welcome. You can bring your own idea, work on one of the suggested problem areas, or join a team that appeals to you on the night.

There are top notch speakers (Barrett Brown and more - see the event pages for [Melbourne](https://internetfreedomhack.org/melbourne) and [Brisbane](https://internetfreedomhack.org/brisbane)), and great [project ideas](https://internetfreedomhack.org/project-ideas) suggested already.

Registration for the Melbourne and Brisbane events is still open. More information is available on the website: [**internetfreedomhack.org**](https://internetfreedomhack.org).
